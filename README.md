# Typing-Test-Using-Web-Scrapping

I have developed a Speed Typing Test project aimed at helping users enhance their typing speed through regular practice. Leveraging web scraping, the program fetches text from online sources. Users can assess their accuracy, typing speed in Words Per Minute, and time taken to complete the given text. The graphical user interface, crafted using Python's Pygame library, features captions, background images, diverse fonts, buttons, and more. Progress is monitored and visualized through detailed graphs displaying accuracy and Words Per Minute, utilizing the Matplotlib library. To facilitate progress tracking, a CSV file stores data on accuracy, attempts, and Words Per Minute. This project offers a cost-free solution for users to test and improve their typing skills offline, eliminating the need for paid licensed versions available online. The user-friendly interface simplifies the experience, making it easy and fast to use while allowing users to analyze their mistakes.
